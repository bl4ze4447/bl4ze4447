projects: 
* [rocket](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/rocket), native cross-platform file manager with multithreaded search and parallel task execution, built with Rust and egui. Uses dedicated modals to monitor and manage concurrent file actions in real time. Sent PR to fix the issue I had with egui, awaiting review.
