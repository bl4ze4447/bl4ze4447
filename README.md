## Welcome

I’m an 18-year-old student, born and living in Romania, with a passion for programming and sports. I primarily work with the following languages:
	- C/C++ – Intermediate
	- C# – Beginner
	-	Python – Beginner
	-	SwiftUI – Beginner

Beyond coding, I love reading. I’ve read The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) and also enjoy non-technical books. Right now, I’m on the second book of The Red Rising trilogy by Pierce Brown.
