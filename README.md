## Welcome

Software development enthusiast with a solid foundation in C and C++, focusing on low-level programming and application development. Familiar with modular design, memory management, and cross-platform development.

My most notable projects are:

* [Codename-TGV](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/Codename-TGV), basic kernel and bootloader, built with C++/NASM, in progress.
* [Flappy Bird Clone](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/Flappy-Bird), clone of the original game, built with C/Raylib.
* [Work-Break](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/Work-Break), windows productivity timer, built with C++/Qt Community, in progress.
* [project-re](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/project-re), native file-manager, built with Rust/egui, abandoned, egui was a bad choice for this project.
