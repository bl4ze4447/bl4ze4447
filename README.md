## Welcome

I am an 18 year old student who likes programming and sports.
I mostly use the following languages:
- C/CPP - Intermediate
- C# - Beginner
- Python - Beginner
- SwiftUI - Beginner

I also love reading, having read ”The C Programming Language, the 2nd Edition”, but I also read non-programming related books, such as the Red Sising trilogy by Pierce Brown (currently on the 2nd book).
