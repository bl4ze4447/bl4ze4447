## Welcome

Software development enthusiast with a solid foundation in C and C++, focusing on low-level programming and application development. Familiar with modular design, memory management, and cross-platform development.

My most notable projects are:

* [Ghiceste cuvantul](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/ghiceste_cuvantul), level-based Wordle with romanian words, developed in Next.js and Typescript.
* [Codename-TGV](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/Codename-TGV), basic kernel and bootloader, built with C++/NASM.
* [project-re](https://github.com/bl4ze4447/project-re), native file-manager, built with Rust/egui, abandoned due to limiations with egui.
